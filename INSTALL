profuse relies on a number of other libraries.  All are open source
and are easy to install.

Required external libraries:
---
BOOST (tested with version 1.46.1):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.46.1/

Seqan snapshot
svn co http://svn.seqan.de/seqan/trunk seqan-trunk

HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra:
http://pedlefsen.github.com/HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra/

Required galosh libraries:
---
prolific (NOT the same thing as "profillic"):  http://galosh.github.com/prolific

FIRST, retrieve and unpack _this_ library (if you have not already done so), and rename the dir to "profuse".  We will assume in the below instructions that all other required libraries will be installed in the parent directory of profuse, though you may adjust them to suit you if that is not the case.

=========
Installing BOOST (if you don't already have it!  Check first eg "locate boost")

On my system, the boost libraries are in /usr/local/lib, and boost includes are in /usr/local/include.  I got them there like so:
# Retrieve boost from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.46.1/
# Unpack it.  From one dir above it:
cd boost_1_46_1
./bootstrap.sh 
sudo bjam install
cd ..

# If you don't have write access to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/include, you should be able to install BOOST in your home directory instead (see the Boost Getting Started docs at eg http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/more/getting_started/ .  Below where it says to link to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include, instead link to your local install dirs.

### NOTE: If you encounter problems later with bjam or with BOOST, it may be because there are multiple BOOST installs on your system.  You may need to first remove the /usr/local/lib/libboost* and /usr/local/include/boost files/dirs, then do the "sudo bjam install" again.  If that fails, consider a local install of BOOST as described above.

# Now go into the profuse directory.
cd profuse
ln -s /usr/local/include boost-include
ln -s /usr/local/lib boost-lib
cd ..

=========
Installing Seqan
## Get Seqan if you don't already have it
svn co http://svn.seqan.de/seqan/trunk seqan-trunk

# Make sure that seqan link in the profillic-hmmer dir points to the right seqan dir.
cd profillic-hmmer
ln -s ../seqan-trunk

=========
Installing HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra.

Retrieve HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra from http://pedlefsen.github.com/HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra/, and unpack it.
# Create the link to it in the profuse dir:
# (note that the hex number "582a53e" might be different for you)
cd profuse
ln -s ../pedlefsen-HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra-582a53e HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra
cd ..

=========
Installing the prolific header-only library.

Retrieve prolific from http://galosh.github.com/prolific/, and unpack it.
# Create the link to it in the profuse dir:
# (note that the hex number "bb99906" might be different for you)
cd profuse
ln -s ../galosh-prolific-bb99906 prolific
cd ..

=========
FINALLY, installing profuse.

cd profuse

# First must make sure you can compile it in the fast-to-compile, slow-to-run "debug" variant, before trying to compile the slow-to-compile "release" variant.
bjam --clean
bjam debug align_AA

# If that works (fingers crossed!), do
bjam install release
# The above will (slowly) compile the executables, and will copy them to the dist/ subdir.

# You might be interested to check out the bjam (Boost.Build) documentation: http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html
